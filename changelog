	* r22
	* Added new straighten_bends algorithm. It works pretty well.
	* Disabled y-coordinate assignment

	* Fixed \t reading bug in GML parser.

2009-10-26  Ahmet Emre Aladağ  <mail@mail.com>

	* r20
	* y coords does not have to start from 0 in order to be recognized. We now
	sort them and assign indices according to this sorting.

2009-10-25  Ahmet Emre Aladağ  <mail@mail.com>
	
	* r19
	* Fixed color option to one color (just to make it work)
	* Increased base height constant in weighted y coordinates method.

	* r16
	* Nodes with #FF8C00 are additionally accepted as dummy nodes.
	* write_txt method introduced for layers/positions writing.
	* write_txt runs at the end of a combined process.

	* Weighted y coordinates are now more apart from each other for small
	weights.

	* Improved get_edge method.
	* Added layers.txt / positions.txt generation / choice support
	* Disabled post adjustments for now, meaning overlaps can happen
